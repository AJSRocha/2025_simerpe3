Correcting for effective area fished in fishery-dependent depletion estimates of abundance and capture efficiency. -- ICES Journal of Marine Science 64: 000--000.Depletion methods are widely used to estimate capture efficiency and abundance. However, they are highly dependent on the depletion area assumed. In open-ocean depletion studies, it is difficult to determine the true area of depletion. Satellite vessel monitoring systems (VMS) offer the potential to determine the area effectively fished. Observer-collected catch-and-effort data from the 1999 Atlantic sea scallop fishery in Georges Bank Closed Area II were used to obtain spatially-explicit DeLury depletion estimates of dredge efficiency and abundance, with corrections for fished area made using VMS data. Non-area-corrected efficiency estimates often had theoretically impossible values, indicating that the na{\"i}vely assumed fished area was likely too big. Fine-scale spatial analyses on individual depletion cells confirmed this result. Corrected-area efficiency estimates exhibited reduced variability and more plausible efficiencies, with 70 \% of 289 individual depletion estimates falling between 20 \% and 55 \%, with a mean of 46 \%. Abundance estimates from individual depletion studies matched maps of abundance from a preseason survey. Results indicated a total abundance of {$\sim$}17 million pounds of scallop meat weight in the fished area, of which 6 million pounds were landed, providing an overall exploitation rate of 35 \%.}

Bayesian state-space modelling of the De Lury depletion model: strengths and limitations of the method, and application to the Moroccan octopus fishery. -- ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 1272--1290.The strengths and limitations of a Bayesian state-space modelling framework are investigated for a De Lury depletion model that accommodates two recruitment pulses per year. The framework was applied to the Moroccan fishery for common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) between 1982 and 2002. To allow identifiability, natural mortality (M) and the recruitment rhythm were fixed, and the variance of both process and observation errors were assumed to be equal. A simulation--estimation (SE) approach was derived to test the performance of the method. If the data showed responses to harvest, the estimates of the most important figures, i.e. the initial abundance and the second recruitment pulse, were accurate, with relatively small bias. Results confirm that greater depletion yields smaller bias and uncertainty and that inferences are sensitive to the mis-specification of M. The 21 depletion series in the Moroccan dataset were jointly treated in a hierarchical model including random walk to capture the systematic fluctuations in estimates of catchability and initial abundance. The model provides estimates of the annual recruitment and monthly octopus population size. The recruitment estimates could be used to investigate the link between recruitment variability and the coastal North African upwelling regime to improve understanding of the dynamics and management of octopus stocks.}

  abstract = {Cuttlefish is a key commercial species in the English Channel fishery in terms of landings and value. Age-based assessment methods are limited by time-consuming age determination with statoliths and the lack of stock assessment models tailored to this data-limited species. A two-stage biomass model is developed in the Bayesian state-space modelling framework that allows inferences to be made on the stock biomass at the start, middle and end of each fishing seasons between 1992 and 2014, while accounting for both process and measurement errors and to assimilate various sources of information. A method that uses ancillary length-frequency data is developed to provide an informative prior distribution for the biomass growth rate parameter g (E = 0.89) and its annual variability (CV = 0.1). The new model is a substantial improvement on the existing stock assessment method used by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas. Taking into consideration a time-varying g parameter provides a more ecologically meaningful model with regard to the sensitivity of the cuttlefish population dynamics to environmental fluctuations and improves model fit. The model also provides predictions of the unexploited biomass in winter, which is based on survey data, and helps manage the stock in the event of strong depletion.},

  abstract = {Purpose{\enspace} Common octopus is the fishing species with highest economic revenue in Portugal, and its consumption per capita is very high. The majority of catches come from the small-scale fleet with pots and traps. The aims were to assess main environmental impacts of common octopus' fishery with traps and pots in the Algarve region, where the most important fleet size and landings volume occurs, and to find if there are significant differences between both fishing gears. Methods{\enspace} The assessment includes standard LCA impact categories, fishery-specific impact categories, and quantification of macroplastics and microplastics emitted to the environment. The functional unit selected was 1 kg of octopus and the study was a `cradle to gate' system. The scope included fishing operations until the product is landed at the harbour. Primary data was obtained by face-to-face questionnaires from 22 vessels, with an average of 1005 pots and 1211 traps per vessel, and 372 pots and 234 traps lost annually to the environment. Plastic pots have a concrete block and traps are a metal framed covered by plastic netting. Each trap or pot is connected to the main line at regular intervals. Unlike traps, pots do not need bait. Results and discussion{\enspace} Fuel contribution to global warming is very high and where the highest potential exists to lower down the carbon footprint. The fuel use intensity resulted in 0.9 L/kg of octopus. The bait used in traps is significant and raises further environmental costs related with fuel consumption. The use of traps represents more than two times the impacts found for pots in all the categories studied except ecotoxicity categories. Zinc use was the main contributor to ecotoxicity categories, but it has not been included in other fishery LCA studies. It was estimated that 12.2 g of plastics is lost to the environment per kg of octopus. The loss of macroplastics from fishing gears was the highest contributor. Conclusions{\enspace} The carbon footprint obtained was 3.1 kg C\- O2 eq per kg of octopus, being lower compared to other seafood products, and less than half compared to octopus caught with trawling. Pots and traps are highly selective fishing gears, causing negligible disturbance to the seafloor. The stock is not assessed, but management measures exist and can be improved. A drawback exists related with gears lost to the environment.},

Mitochondrial markers are ubiquitously used to address phylogeographic questions, and have been used to identify some cryptic species complexes; however, their efficacy in inference of evolutionary processes in the nuclear genome has not been thoroughly investigated. We used double digest restriction siteassociated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) markers to quantify species boundaries in the widely distributed and high value common octopus, Octopus vulgaris, comparing genome-wide phylogenetic signal to that obtained from mitochondrial markers. Phylogenetic analyses, genome-wide concordance and species tree estimation based on 604 genome-wide ddRADseq loci revealed six species within the O. vulgaris group. Divergence time estimates suggested modern-day species evolved over the last 2.5 ma, during a period of global cooling. Importantly, our study identified significant phylogenetic discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear markers; genome-wide nuclear loci supported O. vulgaris sensu stricto and Type III (South Africa) as distinct species, which mtDNA failed to recognise. Our finding of conflicting phylogenetic signal between mitochondrial and nuclear markers has broad implications for many taxa. Improved phylogenetic resolution of O. vulgaris has significant implications for appropriate management of the group and will allow greater accuracy in global fisheries catch statistics.},

We apply these methods to 17 data-rich stocks and compare the status estimates to the accepted International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) age-based assessments. Comparison statistics and receiver operator analysis showed that both methods often differed considerably from the ICES assessment, with CMSY showing a tendency to overestimate relative fishing mortality and underestimate relative stock biomass, whilst SPiCT showed the opposite. CMSY assessments were poor when the default depletion prior ranges differed from the ICES assessments, particularly towards the end of the time series, where some stocks showed signs of recovery. SPiCT assessments showed better correlation with the ICES assessment but often failed to correctly estimate the scale of either F/FMSY of B/BMSY, with the indices lacking the contrast to be informative about catchability and either the intrinsic growth rate or carrying capacity. Results highlight the importance of understanding model tendencies relative to data-rich approaches and warrant caution when adopting these models.},

Identifying the variables driving the quantity and composition of landings is pivotal to understand the dynamics of the fisheries sector, which entails complex social and environmental aspects. In this study, we investigate the main drivers of marine fish landings in continental Portugal between 1989 and 2014. To identify common trends in time series, and quantify the importance of environmental factors, we applied a dynamic factor analysis considering four regions and three types of gear (trawling, purse-seine, and a multi-gear fishery). Our results show the importance of fishing effort as the most relevant factor driving marine landings in Portugal, both at the long and short terms. In addition, the effect of environmental factors such as the winter river discharge and the spring East Atlantic Teleconnection index should not be neglected, probably through mechanisms affecting coastal productivity. We provide a comprehensive amount of information that permits to improve our understanding of the trends of the most important commercial species in Portugal during the period of study.},

  abstract = {The term ``mixed fisheries'' refers to fishing activities where more than one species are caught simultaneously and one species may be fished by different gears. Therefore, mixed fisheries present a harder challenge for fisheries management than single-species fisheries and the uncertainty can start at the definition of the target species. In these particular fisheries, we have a large group of species that are caught, being target or not, species with large landing values that are actually not target, and species with a high economic value that can fall in the bycatch category. Although the dynamics of such fisheries is poorly understood, they are known to have a relevant contribution to Portuguese fishers' revenue. The present demand on sustainable fishing activities to ensure marine ecosystem preservation has led towards an ecosystem approach where effort is being made to take into account biological and technical interactions on management measures and advice. In this work, logbooks data of the Portuguese multi-gear fleet were used to identify different fisheries based on catch composition and gears through cluster analysis (CLARA). Two identified fisheries were used to explore the impact of these fishing activities on the ecosystem scale. This approach was achieved by a productivity and susceptibility analysis and through foodweb analysis. The relation between species vulnerability and their functional role in the ecosystem were highlighted. Technical interactions among fishing gears, and species biological interactions, were explored within and among fisheries. We found and illustrated that these interactions go beyond the fleets and fisheries considered in the present work. This approach allows us to identify key elements that can, ultimately, be relevant to an ecosystem-based approach towards mixed fisheries management.},

  abstract = {This study presents the results of an analysis of data on length, weight maturity stage, and fecundity of the squid Loligo vulgaris. The data are based on monthly sampling, between January 1991 and June 1992, from the landings of a traditional inshore fishery for squid in southern Portugal. Male squid generally have a lower weight than females of equivalent mantle length. The overall ratio of male to female squid is 1.1, with limited periods during autumn and spring when females outnumber males. Mature males occur within the broad size range 115--605 mm, whilst mature females have a more restricted size range within 175--345 mm. Immature stages I--II dominate the population during June and July, and there is progressive maturation of both sexes stage II to mature squid at stage V, between August and the following March and May in the larger males and females, respectively. There is a significant difference between the sizes at which the different sexes achieve maturity (ML50\%), with the male at 245 mm and the female at 227 mm. There is evidence that there are two size modes at which males achieve sexual maturity. It is suggested that maturation of this species takes approximately 8 months in the Algarve. A range of reproductive indices derived from gonad morphometrics in mature squid show a pattern of seasonal development with overall values for gonad maturation indices which are lower during the summer and higher during the autumn to the spring. Fecundity has been estimated by counting the total number of oocytes and ova in the ovary and oviduct of mature (stages IV--V) females. The number of eggs varied between 1441 and 14886 and fecundity was correlated positively with mantle length, body weight, and with length and weight of the nidamental gland.},

  abstract = {Data-limited methods are being developed rapidly to cater to a range of data types and stock characteristics. One class of these methods is catch-only methods (COMs), which seek to determine stock status based largely, or exclusively, on catch histories. Although catch data are the most common information for a fishery, they are susceptible to large errors. Understanding the performance of COMs when catch is mis-specified is necessary before they can be used in fisheries management. This study constructed a simulation-estimation framework to evaluate the performance of two types of COMs, Catch-MSY (CMSY) and catch-only boosted regression trees (zBRT), in inferring stock biomass status (B/BMSY) with consideration of different forms of catch errors, fishing patterns, and prior information. The results showed both COMs tended to bias the estimates of B/BMSY regardless of types of catch errors. The estimation performance of COMs was robust to the constant reporting rate across all fishing patterns, which means constant catch over- or under-reporting would not affect the COM assessment. zBRT showed high sensitivity to fishing patterns and performed best when fishing mortality was constant. CMSY yielded underestimation in most cases, but use of a narrow and informative prior on final depletion improved accuracy in recent years. Neither COM performed well in correctly identifying categorical biomass status (overfished vs. not overfished) across assessment years. We caution that improving catch quality would not improve the estimation of COMs and do not advocate for the application of COMs due to their poor performance.},

Historically, stock assessments have been based on bespoke methods and software. There is now a trend towards the use of flexible, documented, tested and maintained software packages, because use of such packages increases efficiency and consistency in assessments and should lead to more reliable and repeatable assessment outcomes. We have developed a web-site that collates available stock assessment packages (from data-limited to -rich) to provide assessment analysts with a single platform that summarizes the features of the available packages in a consistent manner. We also highlight current state-of-the-art packages, and those that are no longer supported or have been superseded. In addition to providing the packages, the web-site facilitates users of packages to provide feedback to developers regarding which features of other packages could be included in future versions of their packages. We see this effort as a way to support the design of the next generation stock assessment package.},

The coastal mixed-species multi-gear Portuguese fleet comprises medium-sized (\&gt;12 m) vessels, using a diversity of passive gears, and is economically important. For hake (under a recovery plan) and monkfish (overexploited), it contributes \&gt;50\% to their total annual landings. Commercial daily landings in 2005 from 271 vessels were analysed by region using non-hierarchical cluster analysis and multivariate regression trees. The cluster analysis allowed the identification of regional fleet segments with a low mixture of species throughout the year. The multivariate regression trees were applied to clusters of vessels with a high mixture of species, to explain weekly landing profiles (species) by vessel technical characteristics, fishing license, and main landing port. The results showed a link between exploited species and geographic location, and in the north between vessel size and depth and an inshore/offshore range. Finally, from the analysis and for the most important species exploited by the Portuguese multi-gear fleet, it was possible to define two or three vessel groups that accounted for at least 50\% of the landed value.},

  abstract = {Fisheries management requires the best scientific knowledge on the exploitation and conservation status of stocks. This is challenging for by-catch species, for which necessary data for their assessment is more limited than for target ones. That is the case for the thornback ray, Raja clavata, in the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean), whose exploitation and conservation status are addressed here for the first time, in an integrative approach, by using innovative assessment methods and genetic diversity analysis. The time series of fishing landings from 1964 and MEDITS trawl survey data from 2004 were used to apply CMSY++ and Bayesian state-space Schaefer production models. We also estimated the genetic diversity of the Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit I mitochondrial gene from 31 individuals collected during MEDITS surveys. The species showed overexploitation with a current fishing mortality (F) below that producing maximum sustainable yield (FMSY), but with a current stock biomass (B) lower than BMSY. Despite the fact that the exploitation status is stable or even has improved in the last decades, the overexploitation period since the late 1970s seems to have reduced levels of genetic diversity, below those of related species and other populations of R. clavata. This low genetic diversity may entail the loss of adaptive potential, making the species more vulnerable to fishing and the current climate change.},

Landing profiles (LP) were identified based on the species composition of the landings using hierarchical cluster analysis. Four out of a total of 12 different LP were related to cephalopods and other species associated with them. The effects on the landing proportions of a number of variables, year, season and vessel, are analysed for each of the species studied using generalized linear models (GLM). The factor ``vessel'', including an ensemble of technical characteristics as well as the abilities of individual skippers, explained most of the model deviance, strongly reinforcing the existence of a fleet component dedicated to catch cephalopods. However, time also explains much of the variation found in the data. Seasonal alternation between landings of octopodidae and cuttlefish was observed within a small group of old trawlers operating mainly off the south coast, following the abundance cycles of these species. For a larger group of more modern trawlers, operating off the western coast, inter-annual shift between octopus and squid was found, together with a well marked seasonal pattern between the catches of cephalopods and horse mackerel. Spatial patterns of activity were identified using vessel monitoring system (VMS) data available for trawlers in Portugal, demonstrating the existence of cephalopod targeting strategies in Portuguese fish trawling activities.},

  abstract = {Cephalopods, including octopuses, squids, and cuttlefishes, are exploited by both bottom trawl and small-scale fisheries (SSF) in most of the Mediterranean areas. Bottom trawl fisheries regard cephalopods as a valuable bycatch, whereas for SSF, they are among the main target species. Cephalopods account for a relatively small proportion of the total landings in the Mediterranean. However, from an economic point of view, four cephalopods, Eledone cirrhosa, Eledone moschata, Octopus vulgaris, and Sepia officinalis, account for approximately 15\% of the total landing value. Despite their economic importance, there are very few stock assessments of cephalopods in the Mediterranean because it is difficult to assess them by classical age-based methods, given their short life-cycles, and highly variable growth and recruitment. The production of E. cirrhosa, E. moschata, Illex coindettii, Loligo vulgaris, O. vulgaris, S. officinalis, and Todaropsis eblanae in the waters off the south of Sicily accounts for approximately 8\% of the total Mediterranean yield of cephalopods. This study presents the first attempt to assess the state of these cephalopods in the Strait of Sicily by using surplus production models. Since species-wise landing statistics may be unreliable because of their morphological similarity, some octopuses (E. cirrhosa and E. moschata) and ommastrephid squids (I. coindetii and T. eblanae) were assessed combined. Landing data and abundance indices from trawl surveys were used to describe cephalopod stock dynamics through the Bayesian State Space Schaefer model (BSM) and Surplus Production model in Continuous Time (SPiCT) models. As survey data were not considered reliable indicators of their abundance, O. vulgaris, S. officinalis, and L. vulgaris stocks were assessed using the Catch-Maximum Sustainable Yield (CMSY) model. Overall, squid and cuttlefish stocks were observed to be in healthy conditions. However, assessments of octopus stocks indicated that their condition was critical or recovering. Here, we discuss the different stock statuses in the light of evolving fisheries and environmental factors in the area over time. Although cephalopods are not a priority in the current management system of Mediterranean fisheries, the importance of these species in the food web and their relevance for SSF underline their importance and their exploitation status should be periodically evaluated.},

  abstract = {The common octopus Octopus vulgaris Cuvier, 1797 is the most fished cephalopod species along the Spanish coasts. Its catches fluctuate greatly due to the short life cycle of the species and to the annual variability of the recruitment pattern, strongly dependent on the environmental conditions affecting the eggs and paralarvae. This study examines the common octopus fishery, the catch composition, and the main features of the reproductive biology of this species in the Gulf of Alicante (Spanish Eastern coast, Western Mediterranean FAO division 37.1.1). The common octopus fishery was studied analysing the monthly landing and effort data by fishing gear from 1994 to 2005. Monthly samplings of the commercial O. vulgaris landings from trawlers and clay pots from January 2004 to December 2005 resulted in the measuring of 1833 specimens to enable analysis of the catch composition, and allowed the biological sampling of 1176 individuals to provide the reproductive parameters of the species in the study area. The length-weight relationship calculated for the species was BW = 0.51 * DML 2.87. The yearly sex ratios (males: females) were 1:1 (trawl, 2004), 1:0.74 (trawl, 2005), and 1:0.88 (clay pots, 2005). The size (dorsal mantle length, DML) at maturity of the species in the study area was 9.67 cm for males and 14.38 cm for females. The gonadosomatic index reached a peak between April and July for males and in July for females. The Fulton condition index was lower in both sexes between June and September, and for males in November-December, whereas for both sexes the values of the digestive gland index were at their maximum between June and December. The energy allocation between somatic and reproductive growth was investigated and the results suggested that the energy spent on reproduction mainly came from feeding, and not from energy stored in the mantle tissues or in the digestive gland.},

Depletion methods and age-structured models have been used to assess the stock, though they have shown limitations related to the model assumptions and data demand. A two-stage biomass model is, therefore, proposed here using, as input data, four abundance indices derived from survey and commercial trawl data collected by Ifremer and Cefas. The model suggests great interannual variability in abundance during the 17 years of the period considered and a decreasing trend in recent years. Model results suggest that recruitment strength is independent of spawning-- stock biomass, but appears to be influenced by environmental conditions such as sea surface temperature at the start of the life cycle. Trends in exploitation rate do not reveal evidence of overexploitation. Reference points are proposed and suggestions for management of the sustainable utilization of cuttlefish in the English Channel are advanced.},

The animals were successfully maintained in captivity until sacrificed for up to 6 (one animal), 9 (one animal), 18 (the six animals from Naples), and 21 (17 animals) days. The number of increments counted in transverse stylet sections was 18.9 + 1.4 and 20.5 + 1.5 for octopuses maintained for 18 and 21 d, respectively. The mean rate of increment formation was 1.02 increments per day, suggesting a periodicity of 1 increment per day in the stylet.

These patterns are an insidious problem, and can lead to severe errors when providing management advice. Here, we use a simulation framework to show that temporal changes in selectivity, natural mortality, and growth can induce retrospective patterns in integrated, age-structured models. We explore the potential effects on retrospective patterns of catch history patterns, as well as model misspecification due to not accounting for time-varying biological parameters and selectivity. We show that non-zero values for Mohn's {$\rho$} (a common measure for retrospective patterns) can be generated even where there is no model misspecification, but the magnitude of Mohn's {$\rho$} tends to be lower when the model is not misspecified. The magnitude and sign of Mohn's {$\rho$} differed among life histories, with different life histories reacting differently from each type of temporal change. The value of Mohn's {$\rho$} is not related to either the sign or magnitude of bias in the estimate of terminal year biomass. We propose a rule of thumb for values of Mohn's {$\rho$} which can be used to determine whether a stock assessment shows a retrospective pattern.},

  abstract = {WGCEPH worked on six Terms of Reference. These involved reporting on the status of stocks; reviewing advances in stock identification, assessment for fisheries management and for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), including some exploratory stock assessments; reviewing impacts of human activities on cephalopods; developing identification guides and recommendations for fishery data collection; describing the value chain and evaluating market drivers; and reviewing advances in research on environmental tolerance of cephalopods. ToR A is supported by an annual data call for fishery and survey data. During 2019--2021, compared to 1990--2020, cuttlefish remained the most important cephalopod group in terms of weight landed along the European North Atlantic coast, while loliginid squid overtook octopus as the second most important group. Short-finned squid remained the least important group in landings although their relative importance was almost double in 2019--2022 compared to 1992--2020. Total cephalopod landings have been fairly stable since 1992. Cuttlefish landings are towards the low end of the recent range, part of a general downward trend since 2004. Loliginid squid landings in 2019 were close to the maximum seen during the last 20 years but totals for 2020 and 2021 were lower. Annual ommastrephid squid landings are more variable than those of the other two groups and close to the maximum seen during 1992--2021. Octopod landings have generally declined since 2002 but the amount landed in 2021 was higher than in the previous four years. Under ToR B we illustrate that the combination of genetic analysis and statolith shape analysis is a promising method to provide some stock structure information for {$<$}em{$>$}L. forbsii{$<$}/em{$>$}. With the summary of cephalopod assessments, we could illustrate that many cephalopod species could already be included into the MSFD. We further provide material from two reviews in preparation, covering stock assessment methods and challenges faced for cephalopod fisheries management. Finally, we summarise trends in abundance indices, noting evidence of recent declines in cuttlefish and some octopuses of the genus {$<$}em{$>$}Eledone{$<$}/em{$>$}. Under ToR C, we describe progress on the reviews of (i) anthropogenic impacts on cephalopods and (ii) life history and ecology. In relation to life history, new information on {$<$}em{$>$}Eledone cirrhosa{$<$}/em{$>$} from Portugal is included. Under ToR D we provide an update on identification guides, discuss best practice in fishery data collection in relation to maturity determination and sampling intensity for fishery monitoring. Among others, we recommend i) to include the sampling of cephalopods in any fishery that (a) targets cephalopods, (b) targets both cephalopods and demersal fishes or (c) takes cephalopods as an important bycatch, ii) Size-distribution sampling, iii) the use of standardized sampling protocols, iv) an increased sampling effort in cephalopod. Work under ToR E on value chains and market drivers, in conjunction with the Cephs \&amp; Chefs INTERREG project, has resulted in two papers being submitted. Abstracts of these are in the report. Finally, progress under ToR F on environmental tolerance limits of cephalopods and climate envelope models is discussed, noting the need to continue this work during the next cycle.},

  abstract = {The relationship between stock and recruitment in fish populations has been a subject of many studies and some controversy, even to the extent that it has been questioned whether the two can be related in any meaningful way. The denial of a meaningful stock-recruitment relationship has profound and disturbing influences on the science of fish population dynamics and would seem to be something of a policy of despair. A more constructive approach is to acknowledge the difficulties in establishing a stock-recruitment relationship from the available information but still to seek the best interpretation of the data for the purposes for which the analysis is intended. Among the models that have been developed to fit stock-recruitment curves to data sets are the well-known Beverton-Holt and Ricker curves, both of which have two parameters. Less commonly used is the two-parameter model of Cushing. These two-parameter models have been generalized to give three-parameter models whose shape can be varied by settings of the parameters so as to model a wide range of observed stock-recruitment curves. In this paper these models and their underlying assumptions are described. Statistical methods of fitting the curves to data are reviewed with emphasis on the appraisal of the fitted curve, concentrating on the use for which the fitted curve is intended. Methods of choosing between different curves are discussed. The review is illustrated with examples of stock-recruitment data derived for various flatfish stocks. Among the questions that are discussed is whether there are any features of stock-recruitment relationships for flatfish that differentiate them from those of other species. Methods for testing the null hypotheses that there is no relationship between stock and recruitment and that recruitment in flatfish is not influenced by environmental or other biological factors are described. Of the 20 flatfish stocks for which suitable stock and recruitment data are available, it is shown that in six cases there is a statistically significant relationship between stock size and recruitment. In one of these cases the relationship is significantly strengthened by the incorporation of an environmental measurement. Of the six significant stock-recruitment relationships one is strongly domed and three are the right-hand arm of a domed curve. In the other two cases average recruitment increases with increasing stock size, but it is not possible to differentiate between a domed and an asymptotic curve. This evidence of density-dependence in the stock-recruitment relationships for flatfish is further strengthened by an examination of those cases in which the model of constant recruitment, independent of stock size, is not rejected. In eight of these stocks it is shown that the model of constant recruitment is favoured in preference to a model in which recruitment is directly proportional to stock size. Although recruitment may vary about a constant average level over a restricted range of stock size, it is not biologically possible for a population to sustain a high level of recruitment at low stock sizes. Thus in these eight cases there is further evidence of an underlying, but as yet unidentified, stock-recruitment relationship.},

  abstract = {CMSY++, an improved version of the CMSY approach developed from Catch-MSY which uses a Bayesian implementation of a modified Schaefer model and can predict stock status and exploitation, was used in the present study. Evaluating relative performance is vital in situations when dealing with fisheries with different catch time series start years and biological prior information. To identify the influences of data inputs on CMSY++ outputs, this paper evaluated the use of a nominal reported catch and a reconstructed catch dataset of the South Atlantic blue shark alongside different priors of the blue shark's productivity/resilience (r) coupled with different indices of abundance. Results from the present study showed that different catch time series start years did not have a significant influence on the estimation of the biomass and fishing reference points reported by CMSY++. However, uninformative priors of r affected the output results of the model. The developed model runs with varying and joint abundance indices showed conflicting results, as classification rates in the final year changed with respect to the type of index used. However, the model runs indicated that South Atlantic blue shark stock could be overfished (B2020/Bmsy = 0.623 to 1.15) and that overfishing could be occurring (F2020/Fmsy = 0.818 to 1.78). This result is consistent with the results from a previous assessment using a state-space surplus production model applied for the same stock in 2015. Though some potential could be observed when using CMSY++, the results from this model ought to be taken with caution. Additionally, the continuous development of prior information useful for this model would help strengthen its performance.},

However, the implementation, application, and usage of these models vary across regions and case studies. Good practice guidelines can streamline modelling workflows, inform the acceptance or rejection of an assessment, and facilitate the derivation of management advice from accepted assessments. This paper discusses current practices in the application of SPMs and proposes good practice guidelines for their use in stock assessment. We complement our recommendations with results from a simulation study examining the performance of an age-based operating model and a SPM assessment model under 60 scenarios with various assumptions regarding data quantity, quality, and model priors. We provide specific good practice guidelines for two widely used state-space SPMs: SPiCT and JABBA. Finally, we discuss current limitations and suggest avenues for future developments for SPMs.},

Scientific investigations have proved that indirect methods (length frequency data) are not reliable enough and should always be accompanied with one direct method, although these methods are very demanding and time consuming. Today, statoliths are the most frequently used direct method for age estimation. These hard structures are proved to be very useful tool in age determination in squids (Teuthida). On the other hand, there are no standard age determination techniques for cuttlefishes and octopuses (Sepiida and Octopoda) and for these groups of cephalopods scientists are still searching for methods suitable for routine use.},

  abstract = {In southern Portugal, artisanal octopus fisheries play an important socioeconomic role. Live crab bait in traps was used up to 2010 and banned in 2012. Such regulation, based on co-management advice, was not established under a scientific fundament. As a result, a long-standing controversy ensued with some fishing associations claiming that live crab bait increased fishing effort and exploitation rates and therefore risked the octopus stock status, while other fishers denied all these alleged impacts. The issue has not been resolved so far due to lack of scientific studies. In this study, we resolve the controversy conducting experimental fishing to determine by-catch and octopus catch rates using live crab bait versus other types of baits based on fish and assess the stock status of octopus over-time with constant parameters (hypothesis of no effect of the use of live crab bait) versus time-varying parameters (hypothesis of raised exploitation rates and riskier stock status). Bycatch was very low regardless of bait type. Our experimental fishing trials showed that fish-based baits increase bycatch and octopus catch rates. Stock assessment models showed that exploitation rates and stock status do not worsen in years of use of crab bait. We conclude that the use of crab bait in octopus fishery does not lead to increased exploitation rate or risks for stock sustainability status. Other considerations involving fishing costs and fishing operations further highlight the advantages of lifting the ban on the use of live crab bait in the Algarve octopus fishery.},

This method was applied to wild Octopus pallidus to determine gender and seasonal influences on age and growth. A total of 503 individuals (94 males and 409 females) were aged, revealing that O. pallidus can reach a maximum age of approx\- imately 1.6 yr and that spawning occurs throughout the year. Male octopuses on average were signifi\- cantly larger (550 and 482 g for males and females, respectively) and older (259 and 243 d for males and females, respectively) than female, and overall growth rates were positively correlated with tempera\- ture at hatching. However, these differences were secondary to individual growth heterogeneity. Growth of males ranged from 1.32 to 5.33\% body weight (bw) d--1 and females from 1.55 to 6.9\% bw d--1, with no relationship between age and size evident regardless of sex. Stylet increment analysis is a promising technique that could play a role similar role to statoliths in squid as an ageing tool.},

  abstract = {In the world, more than 80\% of the fisheries by numbers and about half of the catches have not been formally analyzed and evaluated due to limited data. It has led to the fast growth of data-poor evaluation methods. There have been various studies carried out on the comparative performance of data-poor and data-moderate methods in evaluating fishery exploitation status. However, most studies to date have focused on coastal fish stocks with simple data sources. It is important to pay attention to high sea fisheries because they are exploited by multiple countries, fishing gears and data may be divrsified and inconsistent. Furthermore, a comparison of the performance of catch-based, length-based, and abundance-based methods to estimate fishery status is needed. This study is the first attempt to apply catch-based, length-based, and abundance-based data-poor methods to stock assessment for an oceanic tuna fishery and to compare the performance with a data-moderate model. Results showed that the three data-poor methods with various types of data did not produce an entirely consistent stock status of the southern Atlantic albacore (Thunnus alalunga) fishery in 2005, as the estimated B2005/BMSY ranged from 0.688 to 1.3 and F2005/FMSY ranged from 0.708 to 1.6. The Monte Carlo Catch maximum sustainable yield model (CMSY) produced a similar time series of B/BMSY and F/FMSY and stock status (recovering) to the Bayesian state-space Schaefer model (BSM). The abundance-based method (AMSY) gave the most conservative condition (overfished) of this fishery. Sensitivity analysis showed the results of the length-based Bayesian biomass estimation method (LBB) are sensitive to Linf settings, and the results with higher Linf were similar to those of other models. However, the LBB results with setting Linf at lower levels produced more optimistic conditions (healthy). Our results highlight that attention should be paid to the settings of model parameter priors and different trends implied in various types of data when using these data-poor methods.},

We apply the model to 13 annual seasons of the Anguilla japonica glass eel fishery in the Shuang River estuary, northeast Taiwan. Estimates of abundance and natural mortality compare well with estimates for other species obtained from experimental studies or from data-rich stock assessment models at similar spatial scales. Parameter estimates are generally robust to biases and imprecision in the fisheries catch and effort data. The size of migration waves arriving at the estuary support a splitting mechanism controlled by eddies during oceanic migration. This extension of generalized depletion model provides a useful tool for the assessment of glass eel fisheries in East Asia, South East Asia, Europe and North America when only fisheries-dependent data are available.},

To date no satisfactory measure of effort was possible for the artisanal fisheries, the greatest source of landings data. Based on the analysis of data on daily landings per vessel collected by the Portuguese Directorate-General for Fisheries from sales within official landing and auction sites, an abundance index in kg day-1 standard vessel-1 is proposed as an alternative to the more customary indices, which are not always available or comparable. This methodology constitutes an improvement to an LPUE index based simply on the landings and number of vessels in operation and appears to be sufficiently robust to be used independently of me{\textasciiacute}tier. Data on 18 months of daily landings of O. vulgaris are used as a case study. The new abundance estimates display time-shifts, changes in importance of peaks and generally lower abundance, in relation to estimates from landings and landings per vessel. The lower abundance estimates, suggest a precautionary approach attitude.},

In this paper, we investigate the use of machine learning models to improve the estimation and forecast of such stock parameters. We propose a hybrid model that combines classical statistical stock assessment models with supervised ML, specifically gradient boosted trees. Our hybrid model leverages the initial estimate provided by the classical model and uses the ML model to make a post-hoc correction to improve accuracy. We experiment with five different stocks and find that the forecast accuracy of recruitment and spawning stock biomass improves considerably in most cases.},

Raw cpue is seldom proportional to abundance over a whole exploitation history and an entire geographic range, because numerous factors affect catch rates. One of the most commonly applied fisheries analyses is standardization of cpue data to remove the effect of factors that bias cpue as an index of abundance. Even if cpue is standardized appropriately, the resulting index of relative abundance, in isolation, provides limited information for management advice or about the effect of fishing. In addition, cpue data generally cannot provide information needed to assess and manage communities or ecosystems. We discuss some of the problems associated with the use of cpue data and some methods to assess and provide management advice about fish populations that can help overcome these problems, including integrated stock assessment models, management strategy evaluation, and adaptive management. We also discuss the inappropriateness of using cpue data to evaluate the status of communities. We use tuna stocks in the Pacific Ocean as examples.},

Most importantly, BSP2 provides a state-space implementation of the deterministic Bayesian generalized surplus production model found in BSP. BSP2 models both process error in the dynamics equations to account for the effects of, e.g., interannual variation in recruitment, and error in predicted observations. BPS2 provides outputs to enable the computation of Bayes factors (BFs). BFs show Bayes posterior weights for different models and can be particularly important when structurally different models suggest different interpretations of stock status. A generalized production function implementation (i.e., the Fletcher model) is incorporated in which the ratio of the most productive stock size to carrying capacity can be set at hypothesized values other than the Schaefer model value of 0.5. The software can accommodate a variety of different priors for key parameters including carrying capacity (K), the maximum rate of population increase (r), and the ratio of stock biomass in the initial year to carrying capacity (Binit/K).},

Assessments of fisheries in tropical reefs have been hampered by the logistic difficulty and costs of making empirical estimates of sustainable yields in multi-species fisheries. To overcome this limitation, we used empirical fish biomass recovery data in high-compliance closures to create a production curve estimate that established biomass and yields at maximum sustained yield (Bmsy). A multivariate machine learning model using environmental and human influence proxies made biomass and yield estimates in 10,815 {$\sim$}6.25~km2 Indian Ocean cells. Subsequent analyses determined the national over- and under-fishing status. Identified proxies of travel time from markets, depth, and fisheries management were the main drivers of biomass and subsequent status. The East African countries of Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique had 18,500~km2 of reef and the lowest regional estimated biomass - losing 17,600 tons of commercial target fish per year. Therefore, the estimated loss is between US\$ 50--150~million per year depending on the worth in the fisheries trade's value chain The more populated islands of Reunion, Mauritius, Mayotte, and Comoros have smaller areas (5000~km2) and losing 3000 tons/year, and {$>$}US\$ 9 million per year. Madagascar has many reefs (13,700~km2) and larger variation in yields with an estimated loss of {$\sim$}6000 tons/y. Increased restrictions could greatly increase the value of Indian Ocean fisheries by promoting the recovery of target biomass and recovering lost income.},

  abstract = {This report presents the key results of a multi-year activity of the Sea Around Us devoted to assessing the status of marine fisheries globally. This was accomplished by estimating, for the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) of all maritime countries and the high seas, the fraction currently left in the sea of the exploited populations of fish and invertebrates that occurred before the onset of large-scale industrial fishing. More precisely, the `fraction left' is the current biomass (B) of a stock relative to its initial biomass (B0), i.e., B/B0. This fraction was estimated for multiple exploited populations (or `stocks') by applying a versatile stock assessment method (CMSY++), whose main features are also described. Altogether, over 2,500 stocks of fish and marine invertebrates (mainly crustaceans such as lobsters and mollusks such as squids) were assessed in the EEZs of countries on five continents and the high seas. These assessments were based mainly on long catch time series (typically 1950 to 2018) but considered, wherever they were available, the results of earlier assessments made by national or international fisheries management bodies. Thus, the evaluations of fisheries status presented herein are not defined by data scarcity; rather, we used all available data pertinent to the status of fisheries in all maritime countries to reduce the uncertainty inherent in all stock assessments. The detailed results of these stock assessments and their supporting data are available on the Sea Around Us website (www.seaaroundus.org). These results will also be used by the Flourishing Ocean Initiative of the Minderoo Foundation, which kindly funded a large part of our catch reconstruction update to 2018 and the stock assessment work described herein.},

They have been applied to the same specimen from a sample of 30 individuals of Octopus vulgaris caught in central-eastern Atlantic waters. These techniques aim at revealing growth increments in the rostrum sagittal sections (RSS) and lateral wall surfaces (LWS) of octopus upper and lower beaks. Both methods were improved to reduce the time of sample preparation and to enhance the appearance of the increments. For each individual, two independent readings were done for upper and lower beak sections, as well as for the lateral wall surfaces. Vertical reflected light (epifluorescence) and image analysis system were shown to be useful in the observation and analysis of the sequence of increments. Precision of the ageing, increment counts obtained by both techniques, and increment widths were discussed. Using upper beak RSS led to more precise age estimates, whereas preparing LWS was quicker and simpler, and revealed a higher number of increments. Therefore, our study recommends counting growth increments in LWS of beaks to age adult common octopus.},

  abstract = {The present study reports a detailed description of the catches of cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) in the trap fishery performed seasonally off the Algarve coast (southern Portugal). A total of 86 fishing surveys were performed during the fishing season (May--September) from 2009 to 2014, on sandy bottoms at bathymetrics ranging from 8 to 10 m depth. During the whole study period, fishing operations involved 6311 cuttlefish traps with a gear catch rate of 37\% (frequency of traps with cuttlefish) and a mean of 0.9 S. officinalis caught per trap. A total of 5883 S. officinalis (1424.0 kg) were caught, being only recorded 282 dead individuals (mortality rate of 4.6\%). The mean fishing yield (standardised CPUE's in number and weight) was 46.6 individuals and 11.3 kg 50 traps-1. Overall, males (n = 3188) outnumbered females (n = 2695), producing a significant male-biased (1 M: 0.85 F) sex ratio. On average, females were significantly larger and heavier (124.4 {\textpm} 22.9 mm ML; 253.1 {\textpm} 148.8 g TW) than males (121.9 {\textpm} 24.0 mm ML; 230.7 {\textpm} 143.1 g TW). Accordingly, the length-frequency distributions displayed significant gender differences, with 89.6\% of females and 85.8\% of males accomplishing the MCRS (100 mm ML). This markedly seasonal, highly sustainable and low impacting small-scale fishery constitutes a locally important socio-economic activity during spring and summer. Undamaged catches and highly fresh individuals further contribute to the considerable price reached by S. officinalis caught using this artisanal fishing gear.},

  abstract = {The European Union (EU) is one of the most important markets for cephalopods in the world. Currently, smallscale fisheries targeting the common octopus in the EU are of considerable social and economic importance, especially in southern European waters where more octopus are consumed as part of the traditional diet. Oc\- topuses in Europe are excluded from quota regulations under the Common Fisheries Policy and EU Member States manage their fisheries employing different input and output control measures, especially in small-scale fisheries targeting the common octopus. The level of participation of the fishing industry in the management of their activity varies amongst Member States and some management arrangements in place are tailored at the local level. This manuscript focuses on four European countries with important small-scale artisanal common octopus fisheries (Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece). It describes and compares the current status of small-scale common octopus fisheries in each country, their socioeconomic importance, the management arrangements in place, and the opportunities and challenges for their future. Despite the increasing importance of octopus fish\- eries in southern Europe, few countries have collected detailed data on the socioeconomic importance and management of these fisheries. The information provided contributes to increase the knowledge about the human dimensions of octopus fisheries in Europe.},

  abstract = {Integrated analysis (or integrated population modelling) methods have become the preferred approach for conducting stock assessments, and providing the basis for management advice for fish and invertebrate stocks since the publication of a seminal paper by Fournier and Archibald in 1982. Methods to assess fish stocks based on single-species, single-area, age-structured models are now standard, with the major debates associated with these models related to data choice, model configuration assumptions, and data weighting. However, the current generation of stock assessment packages is not addressing all of the needs of stock assessment analysts and managers. A major challenge for any next-generation stock assessment package is the set of extensions needed to assess stocks that do not satisfy the `well-mixed single-stock' paradigm. In addition, the next-generation stock assessment package needs to: (a) be able to capture age and size/stage dynamics simultaneously yet computationally efficiently, (b) scale from data-rich to data-poor, (c) include some multi-species capability, and (d) more appropriately deal with temporal variation (e.g., random effects and state-space models). In relation to data, there is a need to ensure that the next-generation stock assessment package better handles tagging data (agesize/stage models may help in this regard), in particular, to be able to use close-kin mark-recapture data. Efficient methods are needed to share parameter priors among stocks (satisfying the promise of the `Robin Hood' paradigm). The next-generation stock assessment package needs to have associated appropriate training programs and documentation. Adoption of such a package will be facilitated by a data entry system that is welldocumented, does not require specification of inputs that will not be used in an application, has an expert system to configure default settings based on best practices, and has associated code to automatically produce diagnostic statistics. Some technical challenges that have plagued stock assessment for decades warrant continued attention (at the theoretical and applied level) such as automatic data weighting and tuning, how to handle spatial and stock structure, improved coding to facilitate application of state-of-the-art methods for quantifying uncertainty, and adoption of true state-space formulations to allow more parameters to be treated as random effects. Future needs for features cannot be anticipated, so the key design consideration for the next-generation stock assessment package is to be flexible and modifiable to meet the requirements of analysts and users.},

The model uses weekly data from 19 seasons to estimate annual recruitment and female spawners emigration out of the vulnerable stock to attend to their broods. The matched annual spawners-recruitment (SR) magnitudes are then used as observations in a non-Bayesian hierarchical inference framework. The Shepherd SR model was selected among three alternatives. The stock has a high degree of density-dependence, leading to overcompensation. The estimated SR model has an unstable equilibrium point, driving the stock to deterministic cyclic fluctuations under small disturbances. Under those conditions the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is not applicable, lending further credence to Sidney Holt's opposition to the MSY as a basis for the elaboration of fishery management objectives, with potentially wide relevance to the management of SSF and cephalopod fisheries. We argue that harvest rates based on mean latent productivity, a concept that includes the MSY as a special case, are more adequate and sustainable for fluctuating stocks.},

  abstract = {A multi-annual and multi-fleet version of a generalized depletion model is developed and applied to the Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson) stock in Saudi waters of the Arabian Gulf under data-limited conditions. The fishing operational data are the official monthly records of estimated catch biomass and exact nominal effort of two artisanal fleets from 1995 to 2012. To transform catch in biomass to catch in numbers, a monthly trend in mean weight is estimated from biological compositional data from 2002, 2013 and used to produce predictions of mean weight for every month between 1995 and 2012. Estimates of natural mortality and initial abundance, thirty six fleet-specific abundance parameters, and six fleet-specific fishing operational parameters, are obtained by maximum likelihood. Thirty six additional timing parameters are fixed by graphical display of catch spikes, a convenient statistic defined here, and by maximum likelihood. The reconstructed history of the stock shows that the catch varies in direct relation to the magnitude of recruitment pulses, while nominal effort has been stable. The annual exploitation rate was estimated at approximately 10\%, which implies that fishing is occurring at sustainable levels, although these results are conditional on a well-behaved mean monthly weight in the catch and simplified statistical models.},

A shortcoming of these models is that although they estimate vulnerable abundance they do not provide direct information on the productivity of the stocks. Here we combine generalized depletion models with a biomass dynamic model of the Pella--Tomlinson type. The inference framework is hierarchical, with initial biomass estimates from generalized depletion models being used as input to the biomass dynamic model to estimate its hyper-parameters. Two hierarchical inference approaches are employed: the standard state-space framework and a new hybrid marginal-estimated approximation to the likelihood function, which make different simplifying assumptions. We apply this assessment approach to the first Chilean fishery with a Management Plan, the southern sea urchin fishery. Results from both hierarchical inference methods show a stock fluctuating between high and low biomass levels, for which maximum sustainable yield appears as a risk-prone annual harvest policy. Given this we propose an alternative annual harvest rate corresponding to the average latent productivity over the years of peaks and troughs of biomass fluctuations.},

Although cephalopod landings are dominated by the squid fishery, which represents nearly 80\% of the worldwide cephalopod catches, octopuses and cuttlefishes represent \$10\% each. Total reported global production of octopuses over the past three decades indicates a relatively steady increase in catch, almost doubling from 179,042 t in 1980 to 355,239 t in 2014. Octopus fisheries are likely to continue to grow in importance and magnitude as many finfish stocks are either fully or over-exploited. More than twenty described octopus species are harvested from some 90 countries worldwide. The current review describes the major octopus fisheries around the globe, providing an overview of species targeted, ecological and biological features of exploited stocks, catches and the key aspects of management.},

Despite the large fluctuations in the octopus abundance series, results showed a strong aggregation pattern for the last 3 months of the year, possibly related to the input of new recruits to the fishery. The calculated common trend for the 12 months time-series presented significant correlations with autumn rainfall of the previous year (lag - 1), particularly for the October, November, and December series. Other important correlations were found for the Western Mediterranean Oscillation index (lag - 1), Ekman transport, summer river run-off (lag - 1), horizontal and vertical component of windstress, among others. The main trend describes a moderate steady increase in LPUE during the last 10 years, suggesting that octopus abundance has increased from 1990 to 2010. The strong correlations of the monthly octopus LPUE series, together with the annual life cycle, suggest that after environmentally controlled recruitment, population dynamics is largely fishery driven, resulting in strong seasonality in the landings.},

The common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) pot and trap fishery in the Algarve (Portugal) holds the potential for implementation of a co-management system. To explore this potential, seven participatory workshops took place between 2014--2015, bringing together 60 participants from 10 fishing associations and 16 fisheries management and research institutions. The exercise resulted in promising outcomes with regards to the possible implementation of a co-management system for the fishery. In the present work an overview of the outcomes of the participatory workshops is given and compared with initiatives worldwide. Among the management actions identified, some have direct impacts on the octopus' life cycle, while all target the same overall objective: to regulate fishing effort. In the informal setting of the workshops, a formal request was developed: the establishment of an annual closed season in the Algarve. This request was taken into consideration by the responsible management institution.},

  abstract = {Recently, various state-space implementations of surplus production models (SPMs) have been developed for data-limited stocks. Often, catches and fishing effort are underestimated and discards are ignored. This results in biased estimates of stock status and reference points. Therefore, we conduct a sensitivity analysis for different under-reporting scenarios (due to non-declared landings, by-catch, and discards) on model estimates and thus advice for the black hake species in northwest Africa. Two modelling frameworks were used, namely a stochastic SPM in continuous time (SPiCT) and Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment (JABBA). A common set of diagnostics was developed to allow comparison across modelling frameworks. Scenarios correspond to hypotheses about misreporting and assumptions and priors that were kept consistent. The ratio of current fishing mortality over the fishing pressure that gives the maximum sustainable yield, F/FMSY, is most affected by under-reporting. Results are sensitive to the prior assumed for the initial depletion level, B0/K, and research is needed. If the misreporting is changing over time, relative quantities (e.g. F/FMSY) and trends are biased, while if misreporting (or at least a part of misreporting) is constant, relative quantities are unbiased. Therefore, the nature of any trend in misreporting should be investigated.},

  abstract = {The basic purpose of fish stock assessment is to provide estimates of the state of the stock to assure, in the long run, the self-sustainability of the stock under exploitation. The three commonly used stock assessment models are reviewed in this paper namely Surplus production model, Empirical model, and Analytical Model. The first model is simpler and considers the stock as a homogenous biomass. It ignores the complexities of age structure and spatial structure and assumes compensatory population growth and provides fishery managers with some important management parameters. Nonetheless, it requires a long time series catch and effort data and assumes stock has stabilized at a current rate of fishing and its ability to accurately describe and predict the dynamics of fish populations depends greatly on the nature of the available data. The second model makes a link between some easily measured characteristic of a water body, such as its area/depth, the conductivity of the water or the mean primary production and an expected yield. However, a major limitation of the Empirical model is that previously observed empirical relationships may break down in situations when conditions change substantially. The third model, on the other hand, requires a detailed description of the stock such as size or age structure of the stock as well as growth and mortality parameters that characterize the population under investigation. As an advantage, this model gives a reliable estimation of yield and biomass of fish that could be exploited sustainably from a given water body. However, such model has been poorly used in developing countries. Since, it is complex, slow, costly and time-consuming. In conclusion, understating the limitation, advantages and applications of each stock assessment model is very important to make a reliable estimate of vigorous fisheries management parameters in order to manage our aquatic resources sustainably.},

Thirty-four species (89.5\% of bycatch taxa) were discarded at sea, corresponding to discard rates of 19.5\% by number and 11.1\% by weight. The short-snouted seahorse, Hippocampus hippocampus (L.), was the third most abundant bycatch species (11.6\% No.; 0.4\% kg) and the second most discarded (12.6\% No.; 0.6\% kg), being invariably discarded live and undamaged owing its conservation status.

In males, females and sexes combined, the W-L relationships were highly significant and the morphometric parameters were highly correlated. Regarding relative growth, males, females and sexes combined displayed negative allometries, reflecting a slower growth rate in total weight than in mantle length during the species ontogeny, being the hypoallometric growth less intense in females than in males. An extensive compilation of analogous data reported throughout the distributional range of S. officinalis (Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea) further confirmed that negative allometries (weaker in females than in males) between specimen size and total weight are a typical feature in this species.

Here, we characterize the major secretions and steroidogenic pathways of the female optic gland using mass spectrometry techniques. We find that at least three pathways are mobilized to increase synthesis of select sterol hormones after reproduction. One pathway generates pregnane steroids, known in other animals to support reproduction.12--16 Two other pathways produce 7-dehydrocholesterol and bile acid intermediates, neither of which were previously known to be involved in semelparity. Our results provide insight into invertebrate cholesterol pathways and confirm a remarkable unity of steroid hormone biology in life history processes across Bilateria.},

  abstract = {Based on length frequency data of miter squid (               Uroteuthis chinensis               ) collected in the northeastern South China Sea in 1975--1977, 1997--1999, and 2018--2019, asymptotic length, optimal length at first capture, relative mortality, and relative biomass of the stock were estimated using length-based Bayesian biomass estimation (LBB). The LBB-estimated asymptotic length for 2018--2019 was smaller. Optimal lengths at first capture for the later far exceeded average lengths in catches because of a major increase in fishing intensity. Between 1975 and 1977, relative total mortality (               Z               /               K               ) was low, but it increased in the latter two periods, while relative natural mortality (               M               /               K               ) showed a downward trend. Relative biomasses (               B               /               B               0               and               B               /               B                                msy                              ) indicated that the stock was close to unexploited between 1975 and 1977, but they declined to the levels of 6\% and 4\% in the later periods, which correspond to growth in fishing horsepower. Indeed, by 2018, fishing horsepower increased by nearly four times the optimal level. The analysis suggests that the stock of miter squid has been overfished since the mid-1980s and is now under heavy fishing pressure. To recover the stock, it is imperative to reduce fishing intensity and enforce size-at-first-capture regulations.},

  abstract = {This study presents a new, open-source modelling software entitled `Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment' (JABBA). JABBA can be used for biomass dynamic stock assessment applications, and has emerged from the development of a Bayesian State-Space Surplus Production Model framework, already applied in stock assessments of sharks, tuna, and billfishes around the world. JABBA presents a unifying, flexible framework for biomass dynamic modelling, runs quickly, and generates reproducible stock status estimates and diagnostic tools. Specific emphasis has been placed on flexibility for specifying alternative scenarios, achieving high stability and improved convergence rates. Default JABBA features include: 1) an integrated state-space tool for averaging and automatically fitting multiple catch per unit effort (CPUE) time series; 2) data-weighting through estimation of additional observation variance for individual or grouped CPUE; 3) selection of Fox, Schaefer, or PellaTomlinson production functions; 4) options to fix or estimate process and observation variance components; 5) model diagnostic tools; 6) future projections for alternative catch regimes; and 7) a suite of inbuilt graphics illustrating model fit diagnostics and stock status results. As a case study, JABBA is applied to the 2017 assessment input data for South Atlantic swordfish (Xiphias gladius). We envision that JABBA will become a widely used, open-source stock assessment tool, readily improved and modified by the global scientific community.},

  abstract = {Age-structured production models (ASPMs) are often preferred over biomass aggregated surplus production models (SPMs) as the former can track the propagation of cohorts and explicitly account for the effects of selective fishing, even in the absence of reliable size- or age data. Here, we introduce `JABBA-Select', an extension of the JABBA software (Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment; Winker et al., 2018), that is able to overcome some of the shortcomings of conventional SPMs and allows a direct comparison to ASPMs. JABBA-Select incorporates life history parameters and fishing selectivity and distinguishes between exploitable biomass (used to fit indices given fishery selectivity) and spawning biomass (used to predict surplus production). Applying JABBA-Select involves using an age-structured equilibrium model to convert the input parameters into multivariate normal priors for surplus-production productivity parameters. We illustrate the main elements of JABBA-Select using the stock parameters of South African silver kob (Argyrosomus inodorus, Scienidae) as a case study. This species is exploited by multiple fisheries and was selected as an example of a data moderate fishery that features strong contrast in selectivity over time and across fleets. For proof-of-concept, we use an age-structured simulation framework to compare the performance of JABBA-Select to: 1) a conventional Bayesian state-space model using a Pella-Tomlinson (PT) production function, 2) an ASPM with deterministic recruitment; and 3) an ASPM with stochastic recruitment. The PT model produced biased estimates of relative and absolute spawning biomass trajectories and associated reference points, which by contrast could be fairly accurately estimated by JABBA-Select. JABBA-Select performed at least as well as the ASPMs in accuracy for most of the performance metrics and best characterized the stock status uncertainty. The results indicate that JABBA-Select is able to accurately account for moderate changes in selectivity and fleet dynamics over time and to provide a robust tool for data-moderate stock assessments.},

  abstract = {Our general purpose is to support the use of known-biomass production models (KBPMs), illustrating their usefulness by addressing the evolution of surplus production (SP) over time and the factors affecting it (e.g. environment). We also demonstrate the utility of KBPMs for multispecies management objectives or for estimating maximum sustainable yield reference points without a stock recruitment function, among other worthwhile applications. To do so, we present different uses of KBPMs, illustrating their application on demersal species in the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) area, specifically for megrim, white anglerfish and European hake stocks. The proposed analytical approach involved fitting single-species and multispecies KBPMs, conducting retrospective analyses and assessing the effects of environmental variability on SP. The findings show that, in general, stock SP increased after a decline in biomass and SP, except for white anglerfish in the southern area. Megrim stocks are the least productive, while hake and northern anglerfish are the most productive. Retrospective analysis revealed SP shifts in northern hake stock for reasons other than biomass variability. Hence, the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), two key climate variability modes in the North Atlantic, were tested for their links to SP, revealing a positive connection between SP and AMO, although further research is necessary. Beyond the specific results of our particular KBPM application, our main conclusion is that KBPMs can serve as a tool complementary to more complex assessment models for resolving unaddressed issues and crosschecking available assessment results.},
